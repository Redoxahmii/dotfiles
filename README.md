# dotfiles

- This contains my dotfiles for deploying Hyprland and my coding environment.
- Keep in mind that the Hyprland dotfiles are meant to be used alongside EndeavourOS KDE.

## Installation

- Use `install.sh` if you want to install only the coding environment.
- Use `hyprland.sh` if you want to install Hyprland.
  - These dotfiles are lean to make it compatible with EndeavourOS KDE.
